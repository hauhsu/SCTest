# Introduction

SCTest is a unit test framework for SystemC.
Unit tests for SystemC have some differences from normal software unit tests.  
SystemC describes hardware, and the simulation is continuous.  
So I think unit tests for a SystemC module is a little bit similar to tests for a chip.  
You put a chip on a testbench, give some inputs and compare the output to a golden pattern.
